# Data Source 

### Data gathering

We used api_crawerl.py to gather data we need. Basically google API helps us fetch leasing apartment names around UMD. With the community name provided, we can thus use Zillow API to fetch renting apartments.
For the review data, we also used place_id with which google provides to gather reviewer and contents for each apartments.

## Data cleaning

We used excel to clean and format data. Then used sql_lab.py to generate DDLs.
